        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How did Spotify save millions on cloud costs within a matter of months?? We made cost optimization just another part of the daily development process. Our newly open sourced <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/cost-insights">Cost Insights plugin</a> makes a team’s cloud costs visible — and actionable — right inside Backstage. So engineers can see the impact of their cloud usage (down to a product and resource level) and make optimizations wherever and whenever it makes sense. By managing cloud costs from the ground up, you can make smarter decisions that let you continue to build and scale quickly, without wasting resources.</p>

<p>Are we turning engineers into accountants? Nope, we’re just letting engineers do what they do best, in the place that feels natural to them: inside Backstage.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Backstage has an ambitious goal: to provide engineers with the best possible developer experience.</p>
<p>A great developer experience leads to happy, creative, and productive engineers. Our belief is that engineers should not have to be experts in various infrastructure tools or disciplines (e.g., machine learning or backend) to be productive. Infrastructure should be abstracted away, so that developers can spend more cycles building and testing, quickly and safely. Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, “Yeah, sure, that sounds nice and all, but how does Backstage actually abstract away infrastructure?” The short answer: <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins">plugins</a>.</p>

<p>Getting authentication right is important. It helps keep your platform safe, it’s one of the first things users will interact with, and there are many different authentication providers to support. To this end, we chose to use <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to provide an easy-to-use, out-of-the-box experience that can be extended to your own, pre-existing authentication providers (known as strategies). The Auth APIs in Backstage serve two purposes: identify the user and provide a way for plugins to request access to third-party services on behalf of the user. We’ve already implemented Google and GitHub authentication to provide examples and to get you started.</p>
