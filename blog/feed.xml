            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Backstage is heading out of alpha and moving onto the path to stable releases and an eventual version 1.0. As the community and ecosystem continue to grow at an increasing rate, we want to provide a solid foundation for everyone building things in, with, and around Backstage. So, today we’re introducing the <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/stability-index">Stability Index</a> — a simple way to find out how likely (or unlikely) a specific package or plugin inside Backstage might be updated with major changes. By indicating the reliability of key features and APIs, this quick reference will help contributors and adopters better plan and coordinate their development efforts going forward.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>How did Spotify save millions on cloud costs within a matter of months?? We made cost optimization just another part of the daily development process. Our newly open sourced <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/cost-insights">Cost Insights plugin</a> makes a team’s cloud costs visible — and actionable — right inside Backstage. So engineers can see the impact of their cloud usage (down to a product and resource level) and make optimizations wherever and whenever it makes sense. By managing cloud costs from the ground up, you can make smarter decisions that let you continue to build and scale quickly, without wasting resources.</p>

<p>Are we turning engineers into accountants? Nope, we’re just letting engineers do what they do best, in the place that feels natural to them: inside Backstage.</p>

            <link>https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/30/plugin-marketplace.html</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Backstage has an ambitious goal: to provide engineers with the best possible developer experience.</p>
<p>A great developer experience leads to happy, creative, and productive engineers. Our belief is that engineers should not have to be experts in various infrastructure tools or disciplines (e.g., machine learning or backend) to be productive. Infrastructure should be abstracted away, so that developers can spend more cycles building and testing, quickly and safely. Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, “Yeah, sure, that sounds nice and all, but how does Backstage actually abstract away infrastructure?” The short answer: <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins">plugins</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/blog/assets/20-07-01/auth-landing.png" alt="auth-landing-page"></p>
<p>Getting authentication right is important. It helps keep your platform safe, it’s one of the first things users will interact with, and there are many different authentication providers to support. To this end, we chose to use <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to provide an easy-to-use, out-of-the-box experience that can be extended to your own, pre-existing authentication providers (known as strategies). The Auth APIs in Backstage serve two purposes: identify the user and provide a way for plugins to request access to third-party services on behalf of the user. We’ve already implemented Google and GitHub authentication to provide examples and to get you started.</p>

Even if the catalog is not ready for production yet, we think this release already demonstrates how Backstage can provide value for your company right out of the box. With your early input and feedback, we hope to create a stronger generally available product.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Thanks to the help from the Backstage community, we’ve made excellent progress and are now moving into Phase 2 of Backstage — building out a Service Catalog and the surrounding systems that will help unify the tools you use to manage your software.</p>
<p>We released the open source version of Backstage a little less than two months ago, and have been thrilled to see so many people jumping in and contributing to the project in its early stages. We’re excited to see what the community can build together as we progress through <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage#project-roadmap">each phase of Backstage</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to make getting started with Backstage as easy as possible. Even though Backstage is still in the early phases of its development, we believe it is important for our users to get a feel for what Backstage really is.</p>
<p>We want users to be able to create their own version of Backstage quickly and easily, so that they can take advantage of all the infrastructure that we’ve built into it — and start exploring.</p>
<p>In this blog post we’ll look at what a Backstage app is and how to create one using our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/cli">CLI</a>.</p>

<p>Backstage is Spotify's open source platform for building developer portals.</p>
<p>It’s the first open source infrastructure platform by Spotify that allows you to focus on building your application instead of reinventing the button. With an elegant and unified, yet opinionated UI/UX for all your tooling and infrastructure, Backstage enables engineers to get up and running faster, which ultimately makes their lives easier and more productive.</p>
